# Codsoft Internship - Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the Codsoft internship in Machine Learning! This internship, spanning from November 5, 2023, to December 5, 2023, involved tackling five diverse tasks. out of 5  i have completed 3 tasks:

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
In this task, I implemented a machine learning model to classify movie genres based on key features. The project highlights my expertise in natural language processing and classification techniques.

## Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction
Task 2 involved developing a predictive model to identify customer churn in subscription-based services. Leveraging historical customer data, I employed algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

## Task 3: Spam SMS Detection
For Task 3, I designed an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings. The project showcases my skills in natural language processing and classification.
